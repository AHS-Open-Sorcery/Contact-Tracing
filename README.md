# Open Sorcery: Smart COVID-19 Event Planner

**Problem:** During the pandemic, we're all trying our best to avoid going out -- but sometimes, it's impossible to avoid. To be as safe as possible, we need many different types of information: how to set up as safely as possible, how to contact-trace, and how much risk is involved in a given event.

**Solution:** In those situations, having a way to easily contact-trace, plan a socially distanced layout, and calculate risk is important. So we made the Smart COVID-19 Event Planner, which helps us figure out many of these factors.

**Features:**
* Layout planning: Our drag-and-drop front-end interface allows the event planner to customize the layout of the event. There will also be an option to automatically configure the layout for maximum social distancing.
* Event management: Event planners will have the option to invite guests to their event using a custom invite link. Guests can view the risk (see below) and make an informed decision before they RSVP. 
* Risk calculation: Both event planners and guests will be able to view the risk that someone at the event will be positive for covid-19 based on the most current case data for the county in question. 
* Contact tracing: We will save the data from the layout for easier contact tracing after the event, if necessary.
